                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Cockroaches in the home or workplace are a serious health issue as they are known to carry disease. Cockroaches not only carry disease but also cause allegoric reactions and contaminant food sources. If you have seen one cockroach the problem can soon turn into a full cockroach infestation.
                        Roaches can quickly become a menace, as they are fast-breeding insects that can survive in the most adverse conditions. It's also fair to say that they have developed immunity against certain pesticides, which makes it hard to eliminate a severe infestation with a product bought over the counter. This is why it's wise to hire a reputable pest management company that can offer you guaranteed results and effective solutions.<h3 class="text-gray-900 text-xl ">This way, you'll avoid:</h3> </p>

              <br>
              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <li>
                    In one year a female mouse can have between 5-10 litters of usually 5-6 babies. That is a new litter almost every month.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Young are born 19-21 days after mating and reach maturity between 6- 10 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mice usually live between 6-12 months but have been known to live up to 2 years in some cases.
                </li>

          </div>
          <h3 class="text-gray-900 text-xl "><br>What To Look For ?</h3>
              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <li>
                    Mice - Although predominantly nocturnal animals, mice have been know to venture out during the day, so it's quite common that you can spot the pest
                </li>
                <li>
                    Damage to food produce - Mice are sporadic eaters so tend to eat little and often. This can lead to a very high risk of cross contamination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Damage to wires/or piping - As previously mentioned , comes from the mice gnawing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Droppings - This is sometimes the easiest way to spot a mouse intruder! Their droppings tend to be black in appearance and are no bigger than a grain of rice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smear marks - Due to the dirty environment that mice live in, their fur tend to be dirty and greasy. When they run along surfaces repeatedly, a black mark can build up. This is known as a smear mark so look out for these!
                </li>
              </p>
            <h3 class="text-gray-900 text-xl "><br> Procedure :</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <li>
                    Our highly trained technicians will first establish where an infestation is coming from. In many cases mice gain access to a premises via the space around piping. As they can squeeze through a gap no bigger than a pencil, entry tends to be extremely easy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once ingress points have been established, a course of treatment/visits will be undertaken with the use of specialist rodenticide baits with aim to reduce the current population of the infestation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When your technician is happy that the infestation has ceased, the client will be informed of ways in which to prevent reoccurring infestations. If you would like to know how World pest control can help you with specialist prevention methods.

                        <li>
                            A female bed bug will lay her eggs within cracks and crevices either on the mattress itself or around the bed. A female bed bug can lay between 200-250 eggs in her lifetime!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the egg has hatched, usually within 6-10 days, the bed bug nymph will instinctively look for a blood meal from its host.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The life span of a bed bug is between 25-35 days.

                        <li>
                            Firstly, an easy sign of an infestation is finding alive or dead bed bugs. They are visible to the naked eye and swell once they have eaten.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Droppings - found on the mattress or around the headboard and bed frame; these are clusters of black spots, usually found around where the bugs are nesting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Blood stains found on the bedding - as we are the food source for bed bugs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bites - as with blood stains, bites can be found after the bed bug has eaten, usually leaving red itchy bites similar to mosquito bites but found more around the face, neck, hands and upper body.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            In most cases we will try to salvage the mattress; however, in some cases we will advise the client to remove the infested mattress to help speed up the extermination process. Many bed bug problems are not localized to just the bed and can be found around the infested room.

                        <li>
                            With our expert knowledge on the bed bug life cycle, an extermination plan will be put in place with regular visits until the infestation has cease.
